In this project I created a clock based on the Arduino platform and used Lixie segments for the number displays. It was written in Arduino IDE and utilizes libraries not available out of the box. 

Said libraries can be found here:

https://www.arduinolibraries.info/libraries/adafruit-tftlcd-library
https://github.com/iot-playground/Arduino/tree/master/external_libraries/DS1302RTC
https://github.com/FastLED/FastLED/

Original libraries used at the time of writing are available in the repository.

For more information, I would suggest reading the .docx documentation. Unfortunately, it is only available in Croatian.
